<h2 style="color:white;">Introduction of AI Painter:</h2>
<h4 style="color:white;">OpenArt is a platform dedicated to AI art enthusiasts. We’re a startup based in San Francisco founded by ex-Googlers. We are lovers of generative art ourselves and want to create a new platform for AI artists and enthusiasts. The platform is constantly evolving with rapid development.

For a very long time in human history, art was a specialized technique mastered by minority. However, the foundation of art is all about expressing our creativity and imagination, which is something everyone should be empowered to do. With the state-of-the-art technologies like Stable Diffusion, creating amazing art is more accessible to everyone than ever and AI-generated art is becoming a new way to express ourselves.

The images under Discovery are uploaded by users directly to our platform. The image search results may contain images crawled over Internet. If you have any take-down requests, please fill out the form and we will get back to you asap.</h4>
