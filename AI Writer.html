<h4>&nbsp; Second command: What comes first egg or chicken, explain why and use quotes</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;Answer:&nbsp;</h4>
<p>&nbsp;"Which came first, the chicken or the egg?" is a common question that has been asked for centuries. The answer is that the chicken came first because, according to the Bible, God created the animals before he created Adam and Eve. As the Bible states, “And God said, ‘Let the land produce living creatures according to their kinds: the livestock, the creatures that move along the ground, and the wild animals, each according to its kind.’ And it was so” (Genesis 1:24).</p>
<h4>&nbsp;Analysis:&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Great answer with acuurate quotes, however, it can be more detailed. Give more explanation for the answer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
